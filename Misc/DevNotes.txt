   mouse down 
   localPositin2Coord
      is off by 1/2 hex or so
   
 	off to upper left 0.8 hexes?
 	look at code
	or is localposition off?
	    check ui toolkit code
	    should show 
	        a corner as 0,0
	        put a visble it over whole hex holde and look at position in debug 
	old code use enter GameObject/Ugui stuff
	so could be off by 1/2 cell
	add cell offset param to the get location code
	
	an offset of 1 seemed to move it about 1 hexes
	  try 0.5,-0.5  or mabye flipped

	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
			
	END NOW

	    if things disappear try changing panel setting to smaller reference resolution	
		
		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.
