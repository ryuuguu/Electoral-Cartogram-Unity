NOW	 
  
  
  make overlay layer size of map layer and put
  details as a fixed pixel size  
  // maplayer is mapSize in pixels
         // it is scaled
         
         //we want overlayLayer to be
         // scale same as map Layer?? yes
         // so we know the start pixel width in scaled size
         // it is mapSize.scale(
         // to have box that goes to world pos of detailsTopRightPos
         // could make overlay layer same scale & position as map layer
         // or could make position zero and add offset for calculations
            pixel width can increase by offset 
               but should be limited to some max multiple of width
            pixel height also can increase and has max to hit screen bottom
            
     my rescale is quit working       
              
  
  why is basic details area not drawing
    try drawing a fixed box
    so the maplayer has correct width & height I think
        maybe I should use world rect width and height
        and x & y 
        that would give me the correct world pos
          from there calc the right scale
            from world pos of top right
                how to scale 
                have max width multiple
                and max height multiple
                anchor to to top right corner
                  
             to make what?
             start with 1x1 then fix 
  
    details Area
        make panel in layout
            black 
            scale same as map 
                see what it looks like
                then change height or width in Pixels
                  use flex box stuff inside
              height change by pixel count?
              
        add labels
            province
            riding
            winner name, party color, party name, %
            scroll box
                list items
                candidate name name, party color, party name, %
        
	
LATER
    scroll 

    Buttons
        vote
        language
        
    details box 
       list
       scroll
    
	    add text Labels overtop of hex locations
	        should be editable
	
     make visibile
     switch to square
     
     box with info
      
     hex color from outside to inside
        party getting 1% in center and 
            always visible not blocked by border.
                
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
	
Blog 
	    if things disappear try changing panel setting to smaller reference resolution	
		
		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.
