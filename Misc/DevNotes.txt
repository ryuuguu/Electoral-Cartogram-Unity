    how to change layout inside flexbox
        to put items at end
    
NOW	 

    show hex marker in non edit mode
    select center hax
      
    in UitHexGridMap.Moveto(coord)
        reverse Position2Coord(localMousePosition
        to mouseposti0n from Coord  
           deciding if on right or left side of the board
      
    arrow keys 
       move selected hex around   
        
    Save alternate file names
        get list of filenames from method
                    struct name plus fixed path
                show list
                select name struct 
                or enter new name
    load alternate file names
        get list of filenames from method
            struct name plus fixed path
        show list
        select name struct 
            save to there
            
          
    next make editor in Uit
                             
        editor needs to make map data
            region levels
            region text overlay
                font size
            border colors
        
        make hex grid given dimensions 
            click on hex assign region
                
                region scroll list Panel
                    arrow keys 
                        move selected hex around

                                             
        party color data
            include use other color
    
    
    when editor and same map done
    
        remove old uGUI code
        clean bugs related to not using data
        
        clean code over all
            obviously commented problems
            remove all names from code and use constant file
        
        if I split off may lose editor stuff
        so need copy here
       
        
   
LATER

   
    
	 add text Labels overtop of hex locations for regions
	        should be editable
	
     make visibile
     switch to square
     
     box with info Canada wide 
        seats per party
        votes per party
        
                 
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
	Editing mode need language control event 
	   deleted it by accident
	   
	Website
	    consider VUE build with images and data files
            split web into 
                Unity app with editing
                typescript choose region & display only
            consider storing user data on a game server
                login & stuff?
                save files to it
                
                so what would I need in a minimal web server
                    maybe a no login site
                    just server the view only web app
                        can data come from game server?
                        view only web server logs into app as special user

evolution take idea from the sapling game
    combines with ants
    evolution ant wars

    minimal
        first scenario
            choose ratios
                queen
                drone
                workers
            choose ration switch limitS
                after producing some mush mass switch
                    more queen & drone
        
        next    
            increase types of caste
                carrier
                warrior
                    why are these needed?
                        hunting 
                        defending
        next
            subcastes
            
        next 
            custom caste
                design own caste
                larger queens
                    more offspring
                    larger drone mate more queens
        next 
            more terrain & food sources
                new attributes to exploit
                foods
                    aphids
                    nector
                    seeds
                    leaves & fungi
                    water food ??
                        sugar water 
                    other insects that fight back
                    other ants
                dessert
                    heat resistance increase foraging in daytime
                       
        Ants only 
            check insect models
             
            check again at 3d model sites
                does not have to be free
            
        what attributes
            see below
            need OK visuals     
        

    want unity sample project has a couple low poly models walking around
    
    just make with boxes on flat ground first
        3 jointed boxes with 6 legs jaws 

    Swarms
    ant colony
        queen produces max amount of offspring(if enough food) then dies
        max amount of offspring is fixed for game
        workers
            physical attributes
                cost total attributes ^1.5
                base size 10
                
                attack value
                armour value
                movement (based on total others)
                Carry (food) 
                
        
            behaviour attributes are free
                aggression
                run when hurt level
                carry sastify level
            
            casts are set values for attributes
            
        cast mix is queen attribute
            queen-drone delay amount 
                do not produce any queen drone untill amount has been spent on workers
                can be set as % of total amount produceable.  
            
        queen
            amount of food starts with
        drone
            fixed drone cost
