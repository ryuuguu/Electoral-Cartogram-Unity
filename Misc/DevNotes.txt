		make square subgrid code
		10x10 rectangle of shape parent is 
		create in correct order.
		
			need subgrid cell template thingy
			can just use same as supercell and scale 
			  for square 0.1 0.1
			  
		make subgrid holder than can be turned on or off
		need to keep ref	  
		
		how is subhex location relative to parent?
			ttransform is global
			but IStyle.position  plus top and left
			So I should not use transfor
		what is the size of a cell?
			either hex diameter or height width of a square
		
		where is ref link between co-ord and cell or border   
	
		ColorSubGrid() take a VE and then just color the kids
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
			
		make Uit version for these UitHexGridMapGrid
			mapGrid.CreateCellRegion(cd.cubeCoord,rl);
				var cell = (UitHexGridMapCell)  AddCell(v3,ls);
					what does this mean now
				    	before it meant
				    		creating GOs and putting hieracrhy
				    	now
				    		create Uit XML
				    		put link in dictionaries
				    			what dictionaries 
				    				UitHexGrid.hexes 
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, UitHex>>
				    					<localspaceID,<coord,hex element>>
				    				UitHexBorderGrid.Borders
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, HexBorder>>
				    					struct HexBorder 
        									VisualElement borderholder;
        									VisualElement[] borders;
				    				UIDocExampleManager has holder UitHexGrid & UitHexBorderGrid
				    				
				    				need a 3rd dict for <coord, regionData>
				    			
				    		maybe make callbacks of some sort with dict key
				    			later
			mapCell.SetBorder();
	END NOW
