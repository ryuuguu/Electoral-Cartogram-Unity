    clean code over all
        obivously commented problems
        remove all names from code and use constant file
    
   if I split off May lose editor stuff
   so need copy here
   
   Commit to keep UGUI version so I can look at editor stuff later
   
   consider VUE build with images and data files
   
   
LATER

   
    
	 add text Labels overtop of hex locations for regions
	        should be editable

				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
	Editing mode need language control event 
	   deleted it by accident
Blog 
	    if things disappear try changing panel setting to smaller reference resolution	
		
		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.

    evolution take idea from the sapling game
        combines with ants
        evolution an wars
   
    
    let players build interesting stuff to start
        Ants only 
            check ant models
            
        what attributes
            see below
            need good visuals     
        

    want unity sample project has a couple low poly models walking around
    
    just make with boxes on flat ground first

    Swarms
    ant colony
        queen produces max amount of offspring(if enough food) then dies
        max amount of offspring is fixed for game
        workers
            physical attributes
                cost total attributes ^1.5
                base size 10
                
                attack value
                armour value
                movement (based on total others)
                Carry (food) 
                
        
            behaviour attributes are free
                aggression
                run when hurt level
                carry sastify level
            
            casts are set values for attributes
            
        cast mix is queen attribute
            queen-drone delay amount 
                do not produce any queen drone untill amount has been spent on workers
                can be set as % of total amount produceable.  
            
        queen
            amount of food starts with
        drone
            fixed drone cost
