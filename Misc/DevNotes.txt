	
NOW	 
	hex(square) scaling is not working
	something screwed between hex size and hex spacing
	    check that hex scale and position both are not changed by rescale
	   get a single hex and check sclae and postion

    maybe I need to redo the image chache stuff
       width and height  do not match 
       pos diffs o  a global scale 
       what about on local scale?
       
       solid maybe ok 
       
       
    

	hexes look better
	UitHex can't be 1 px?
	so include a base scale.  userdefined data?  
		make subgrid holder than can be turned on or off
		need to keep ref	  
	
LATER	
     recheck square 
         Make not 1px 
            so it can be made to hex
            
	 Make hex instead square   
	    global mouse to hex or square coord
	        hex use existing code
	        square - ?
	        circle-?
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
			
		make Uit version for these UitHexGridMapGrid
			mapGrid.CreateCellRegion(cd.cubeCoord,rl);
				var cell = (UitHexGridMapCell)  AddCell(v3,ls);
					what does this mean now
				    	before it meant
				    		creating GOs and putting hieracrhy
				    	now
				    		create Uit XML
				    		put link in dictionaries
				    			what dictionaries 
				    				UitHexGrid.hexes 
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, UitHex>>
				    					<localspaceID,<coord,hex element>>
				    				UitHexBorderGrid.Borders
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, HexBorder>>
				    					struct HexBorder 
        									VisualElement borderholder;
        									VisualElement[] borders;
				    				UIDocExampleManager has holder UitHexGrid & UitHexBorderGrid
				    				
				    				need a 3rd dict for <coord, regionData>
				    			
				    		maybe make callbacks of some sort with dict key
				    			later
			mapCell.SetBorder();
	END NOW
	
	Tooltip
	 use global mouse to hex coord
	
	I need to separate logic and presentation classes more

		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.
