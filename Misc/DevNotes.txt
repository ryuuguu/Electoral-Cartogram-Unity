NOW	 
    current problem 
    
     TextElement.MeasureTextSize
                                
  
     make Unity version that uses images and data files only 
        project tiny version
            2D
            center map
            laod maps to  ??
                resize
            TopBar
                make two 2D buttons
                    seats
                    Francais 
            CubeCoord
                translate mouse to coord
                    show ToolTip  2D
                make right info2Area
                    show riding data
                info1Area   
                    show party data
                    how to handle large list
                        add info3Area & info4Area 
                            bottom center         
       

        for projectTiny version read from 
            either build with or get from server
                Map Images
                    seats
                    votes
                Mapdata.json - O in different directory (resouce)
                RegionList
                PartyDatasWrapper
                MapLayout.json
            from server use files
            build with make a scene with objects
                could read data during build 
                    use an authoring script to read it
                    then move it to DOTS component         
                              
     TextElement.MeasureTextSize
             use to resize text 
    VUE
        read from server 
     
    WebGL (non mobile) mapMaker
        read files from 
            server
            playfab
         write file
            playfab user
    
    WebGL viewer
        read files from
            server 
         
    App mobile
        read file from
            server
            playFab if logged in
        write file
            playfab
            
    publish Me only?
        reads from playfab and sends to server
     
          
          
    Save alternate file names
        get list of filenames from method
                    struct name plus fixed path
                show list
                select name struct 
                or enter new name
    load alternate file names
        get list of filenames from method
            struct name plus fixed path
        show list
        select name struct 
            save to there
                
    do vue stuff first?              
        editor needs to make map data
            region levels
            region text overlay
                font size
            border colors
        
        set hex grid  rect size
        set MapSize
            
                                             
        party color data
            include use other color
        
    next make more runtime editor in Uit
    
    when editor and same map done
        text Labels overtop of hex locations for regions
            should be editable
            
        remove old uGUI code
        clean bugs related to not using data
        
        clean code over all
            obviously commented problems
            remove all names from code and use constant file
        
        if I split off may lose editor stuff
        so need copy here

		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code

	Website
	    app can read write files to website under user?
	    app can read and write local files
	    app can read and write shared space on web
	    app can generate png of seats & votes
	
	    consider VUE build with images and data files
            split web into 
                Unity app with editing
                typescript choose region & display only
            consider storing user data on a game server
                login & stuff?
                save files to it
                
                so what would I need in a minimal web server
                    maybe a no login site
                    just server the view only web app
                        can data come from game server?
                        view only web server logs into app as special user

evolution take idea from the sapling game
    combines with ants
    evolution ant wars

    minimal
        first scenario
            choose ratios
                queen
                drone
                workers
            choose ration switch limitS
                after producing some mush mass switch
                    more queen & drone
        
        next    
            increase types of caste
                carrier
                warrior
                    why are these needed?
                        hunting 
                        defending
        next
            subcastes
            
        next 
            custom caste
                design own caste
                larger queens
                    more offspring
                    larger drone mate more queens
        next 
            more terrain & food sources
                new attributes to exploit
                foods
                    aphids
                    nector
                    seeds
                    leaves & fungi
                    water food ??
                        sugar water 
                    other insects that fight back
                    other ants
                dessert
                    heat resistance increase foraging in daytime
                       
        Ants only 
            check insect models
             
            check again at 3d model sites
                does not have to be free
            
        what attributes
            see below
            need OK visuals     
        

    want unity sample project has a couple low poly models walking around
    
    just make with boxes on flat ground first
        3 jointed boxes with 6 legs jaws 

    Swarms
    ant colony
        queen produces max amount of offspring(if enough food) then dies
        max amount of offspring is fixed for game
        workers
            physical attributes
                cost total attributes ^1.5
                base size 10
                
                attack value
                armour value
                movement (based on total others)
                Carry (food) 
                
        
            behaviour attributes are free
                aggression
                run when hurt level
                carry sastify level
            
            casts are set values for attributes
            
        cast mix is queen attribute
            queen-drone delay amount 
                do not produce any queen drone untill amount has been spent on workers
                can be set as % of total amount produceable.  
            
        queen
            amount of food starts with
        drone
            fixed drone cost
