    how to change layout inside flexbox
        to put items at end
    
NOW	         
          
    next make editor in Uit
       
       need UitRegionEditor
            based on region editor
            need highlight/mark a cell
            track a cell
                just by coord?
            assign region ID to map coord  
                ChangeMapData() untested
                unassigned returned value if different from set value
          
            on cell select
                set coord
                move display left or Right
            need OK button for setting no riding regions
            need wasd and arrow movement
            cancel button to set to default region 
                water?
            
                    
          
       make editor VE
      
       regionListView should only be created in edit mode
       should be cleared on leaving edit mode
                  
                   
        expanding tree display control list
            check about what is needed to make it proper control
                UXMLFactory
                UXMLTrait
            
            main problem is keeping correct position when scrolled
                and expansion changes
            try to keep just clicked item in same place
                it will be the one that expands or collapse
                maybe can just set is aselected 
                  probably not
                  
                
            also when an item is used it will be removed 
                selection should move up or down one.
                   
    
        editor needs to make map data
            region levels
            region text overlay
                font size
            border colors
        
        make hex grid given dimensions 
            click on hex assign region
                
                region scroll list Panel
                    arrow keys 
                        move selected hex around
                    buttons 
                        save map ??
                        reload map ??
                        reset??
                        ok - set region to selected value
                    expand tree only when selected
                    region ID name
                      is constituency
                      count of unassigned constitencies under tree
                    
         
                      
        party color data
            include use other color
    
    
    remove old uGUI code
    clean bugs related to not using data
    
    clean code over all
        obviously commented problems
        remove all names from code and use constant file
    
    if I split off may lose editor stuff
    so need copy here
   
    Commit to keep UGUI version so I can look at editor stuff later
   
     
   
   
LATER

   
    
	 add text Labels overtop of hex locations for regions
	        should be editable
	
     make visibile
     switch to square
     
     box with info Canada wide 
        seats per party
        votes per party
        
                 
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
	Editing mode need language control event 
	   deleted it by accident
	   
	Website
	    consider VUE build with images and data files
            split web into 
                Unity app with editing
                typescript choose region & display only
            consider storing user data on a game server
                login & stuff?
                save files to it
                
                so what would I need in a minimal web server
                    maybe a no login site
                    just server the view only web app
                        can data come from game server?
                        view only web server logs into app as special user

evolution take idea from the sapling game

    evolution ant wars

    minimal
        first scenario
            choose ratios
                queen
                drone
                workers
            choose ration switch limitS
                after producing some mush mass switch
                    more queen & drone
        
        next    
            increase types of caste
                carrier
                warrior
                    why are these needed?
                        hunting 
                        defending
        next

        next 
            custom caste
                design own caste
                larger queens
                    more offspring
                    larger drone mate more queens
        next 
            more terrain & food sources
                new attributes to exploit
                foods

                    other insects that fight back
                    other ants
                dessert
                    heat resistance increase foraging in daytime

            check insect models

        cast mix is queen attribute
            queen-drone delay amount 
                do not produce any queen drone untill amount has been spent on workers
                can be set as % of total amount produceable.
