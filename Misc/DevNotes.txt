	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
	    
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
	
Blog 
	    if things disappear try changing panel setting to smaller reference resolution	
		
		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled. 
		
DOTS project

    want unity sample project has a couple low poly models walking around
    
    just make with boxes on flat ground first

    Swarms
    ant colony
        queen produces max amount of offspring(if enough food) then dies
        max amount of offspring is fixed for game
        workers
            physical attributes
                cost total attributes ^1.5
                base size 10
                
                attack value
                armour value
                movement (based on total others)
                Carry (food) 
                
        
            behaviour attributes are free
                aggression
                run when hurt level
                carry sastify level
            
            casts are set values for attributes
            
        cast mix is queen attribute
            queen-drone delay amount 
                do not produce any queen drone untill amount has been spent on workers
                can be set as % of total amount produceable.  
            
        queen
            amount of food starts with
        drone
            fixed drone cost
