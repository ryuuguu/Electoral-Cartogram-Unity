HexGrid 
	
	
	NOW	
	 	Matrix4x4.MultiplyPoint3x4
	 		
	    can I make flex box the matches a certain ratio
            also need to make the bottom left corner flex box
		
		goal select area of a given dimension at the center of the screen  
		    need top right corner of details pane in map coords. 
		    draw another bottom left box that stretches
		    
		 make subgrid holder than can be turned on or off
		need to keep ref	  
	
LATER	
	Scaling screws everything up
    		    RuntimePanelUtils.ResetDynamicAtlas(IPanel) - is screen size changes
	    borders
	    
	    global mouse to hex or square coord
	        hex use existng code
	        square - ?
	
	Redesign
		isSquare
			where is isSquare 
				UitHexGrid (UitHexMapGrid is a subclass)
		use overlay global grid postion not buttons
		how to turn on and off subgrids
			keep list of subgrid elements and turn on/off
			 list in UitHexMapGrid 
				IStyle.visibility
				IStyle.display
		
	Bugs
		why does it need regionList serialized in scene?
			why not just use mapdata & election data?	
			  
		need to treat this code like a code review coding exercise
		  tutorial how to use for myself.
		  finished example code
		    		
			
		make Uit version for these UitHexGridMapGrid
			mapGrid.CreateCellRegion(cd.cubeCoord,rl);
				var cell = (UitHexGridMapCell)  AddCell(v3,ls);
					what does this mean now
				    	before it meant
				    		creating GOs and putting hieracrhy
				    	now
				    		create Uit XML
				    		put link in dictionaries
				    			what dictionaries 
				    				UitHexGrid.hexes 
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, UitHex>>
				    					<localspaceID,<coord,hex element>>
				    				UitHexBorderGrid.Borders
				    					Dictionary<string,Dictionary<Vector3, HexBorder>>
				    					struct HexBorder 
        									VisualElement borderholder;
        									VisualElement[] borders;
				    				UIDocExampleManager has holder UitHexGrid & UitHexBorderGrid
				    				
				    				need a 3rd dict for <coord, regionData>
				    			
				    		maybe make callbacks of some sort with dict key
				    			later
			mapCell.SetBorder();
	END NOW
	
	Tooltip
	 use global mouse to hex coord
	
	I need to separate logic and presentation classes more

	    if things disappear try chaning panel setting to small reference resolution	
		
		ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
		
		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.
