Intro
 Goal of blog
    cover development of drawing a hex map in Unity UI Toolkit from data
    this is not a tutorial so there will be mistakes and changes as the between articles
    Also UI Tutorial is in preview so it hs bugs and there will changes.
    I will make this available under an MIT licence as it progresses.
 
 goal of this article
    initialize UI Toolkit panel and make map area of the correct ratio as large as possible that will be centered at the top and centered. When I checked how to do this with HTML I found answers on StackOverflow saying it is easy in JavaScript but doing it in HTML is messy and does not cover all cases. So I do it mainly in C# and later move parts to USS and UXML that those can handle easily.
    There is also box on the lower left that covers a part of the map that is blank and should resize to be as large as possible.
    
    3  images of shots of layouts.
    
    cover 
    Start()
        overall logic 
    
    Init()
        setup UI ToolKit objects
    
    NewScaledAt()
        draw box
    
    ScalePositionMap()
    
    ScreenToPanel does not work use temporary utilites
    UitUtility
        ScreenToPanel()
        ResolveScale()
        
        RuntimePanelUtils.ScreenToPanel  Vector2
    
    
 if things disappear try changing panel setting to smaller reference resolution	
 		
 		
 		
 		make thing private so that in unity 2020.2 compile time can be reduced. If use assmeblies and only private things change the other assembly do not need to be recompiled.
